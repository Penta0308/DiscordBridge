## Migrating from version 1.x.x to latest
- `/discord default` command and default account are no longer available. You must setup a Discord Bot for the plugin to properly function.
- You have to manually rename config folder `com.nguyenquyhy.spongediscord` into `discordbridge` due to plugin ID change.
- Your current configuration will be migrated automatically from `config.conf` into `config.json`.
- Invite code has been removed. Please contact me if you have specific need for that.
- Default anonymous chat template is changed to ```"`%a:\` %s"```, which looks nicer in my opinion.

## Migrating from version 2.0.0 to latest
- You have to manually rename config folder `com.nguyenquyhy.spongediscord` into `discordbridge` due to plugin ID change.
